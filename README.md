# stack_flutter

A new Flutter project.
```
The stack is a widget in Flutter.
It contains a list of widgets and places them on top of each other.
And it places their children on top of each other like a stack of books. 
In other words, stack developers would overlap multiple widgets on one screen.
As you can add different images or colors using containers in it.
